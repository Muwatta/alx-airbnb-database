## 📝 Project Overview

This project is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, designed to give
learners hands-on experience in designing, building, and populating a relational
database for an Airbnb-like application.

By completing this project, you will simulate a production-level database
environment, focusing on:

- **Database design** with Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
- **Normalization** to ensure data efficiency and integrity
- **Schema creation** using SQL DDL with constraints, indexes, and relationships
- **Seeding** realistic data to simulate real-world operations

This project emphasizes **scalability, performance, and real-world
functionality**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

1. Model complex systems using advanced database design principles.
2. Apply normalization techniques to achieve **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.
3. Write SQL DDL statements to define schemas with **primary/foreign keys,
   constraints, and indexes**.
4. Populate databases with realistic sample data using SQL DML.
5. Document your process and manage repositories professionally for
   collaboration and review.
